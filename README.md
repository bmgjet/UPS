On first launch, it will auto-detect the USB settings and generate a configuration file:

```
BMGUPS.config
```

### 2. Configuration file layout

```
UPSSize | Batterys | CostKWh | PowerFactor
```

- `UPSSize`: VA rating of the UPS
- `Batterys`: Number of battery packs
- `CostKWh`: Electricity cost per kWh
- `PowerFactor`: Efficiency (e.g., 0.8)

### 3. CSV Logging (Optional)

To record output to a CSV file:

```bash
BMGUPS.exe mylog.csv
```

This will continuously append new UPS data to `mylog.csv`.

### 4. Power Usage Tracking

Every 5 minutes, `KWh.txt` is updated with cumulative power usage.  
**IMPORTANT:** Always close the app with `CTRL+C` so the final data is saved correctly.
